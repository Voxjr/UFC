Brasil (10-4) is a DWCS standout that has gone 2-2 in the octagon since her debut on the program. "The Special One" beat Molly McCann in her last fight in July.

Finally, Colby Thicknesse faces Aleksandre Topuria. Born in Windang, Thicknesse (7-0) won the 2020 Oceania Open Championships. He makes his UFC debut after winning four fights in 2024, with three straight ending in the first round.
